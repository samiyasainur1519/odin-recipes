<h3>Even a novice cook can master the art of perfect pizza with our step-by-step guide.</h3>
<p> This homemade pizza recipe features a simple pizza dough and toppings. </p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li> 300g bread flour </li>
    <li> 1 tsp instant yeast </li>
    <li> 1 tsp salt </li>
    <li> 2 tsp olive oil</li>
    <li> 100ml passata </li>
    <li> handful of basil </li>
    <li>1 garlic clove </li>
    <li> 125g ball mozzarella </li>
    <li>  handful of cherry tomatoes </li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan (optional) </li>
</ul>

<h4> Steps </h4>
<ol> 
    <li>Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.</li>
    <li> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. </li>
    <li> Give the flours a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
    <li> Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put a pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.</li>
